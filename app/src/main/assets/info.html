<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This app allows to start termux with the termux-api apk and downloads the package available at https://github.com/StevenSalazarM/Termux-api-bluetooth.</p>
<p>The idea is to avoid the manual installation of termux-api application and the package (through termux console).</p>
<p>In addition to the termux-api-package available at https://github.com/termux/termux-api-package I added two scripts that allows to interact with bluetooth devices.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Once you have installed this application just move to console and write the commands that you want.<br>For <i>termux-bluetooth-scaninfo</i> the application will ask to grant the premission.</p>
<p>After you have given the permission, the next time you call <i>termux-bluetooth-scaninfo</i> it will start to scan the bluetooth devices near to you and you should type again <i>termux-bluetooth-scaninfo</i> to stop the scanning and show the results.</p>


<p>
<small>This is app was built starting from the Termux-App project v0.64.</small><br>
<small>Later versions are available in the official repository https://github.com/termux/termux-app</small>
