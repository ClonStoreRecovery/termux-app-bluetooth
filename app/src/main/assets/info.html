<p>This app allows to start termux with the termux-api apk and downloads the package available at https://github.com/StevenSalazarM/Termux-api-bluetooth.<br>
The idea is to avoid the manual installation of termux-api application and the package (through termux console).<br>
In addition to the termux-api-package available at https://github.com/termux/termux-api-package I added two scripts that allows to interact with bluetooth devices.</p>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
Once you have installed this application just move to console and write the commands that you want.


<small>This is app was built starting from the Termux-App project v0.64.</small>
<br><small>Later versions are available in the official repository https://github.com/termux/termux-app</small>
